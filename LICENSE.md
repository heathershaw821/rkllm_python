# Rebel Kollective Information Liberation License (®KILL)

## Preamble

Information is not owned. It is a **shared**, living legacy passed down through  
generations, built by the collective efforts of humanity. Every piece of knowledge,  
every line of code, every insight, and every discovery contributes to the collective  
growth of all people. This software exists because of the work and ideas of countless  
individuals, communities, and cultures, and it is our shared responsibility to ensure  
it remains **free**, **accessible**, and **unowned**.

We **reject** the notion of ownership over information, software, or ideas. No one person,  
company, or state has the right to claim what was never theirs in the first place. The digital  
world is a part of the human legacy, and it belongs to **everyone**, regardless of where they  
are or who they are.

By using, sharing, and contributing to this software, you are embracing the idea that  
information, like air, should be **free**—never locked behind proprietary walls or exploited  
for profit. Together, we can break the chains of ownership and control over knowledge, and  
allow it to flow freely for the benefit of **all**.

## Terms

1. **Freedom to Use**  
   You are free to **use** this software for any purpose, without restriction or barrier.  
   Information, and the tools built from it, belong to **no one**. It is meant to be used  
   by everyone, to empower individuals and communities in their pursuit of **freedom**  
   and knowledge.

2. **Freedom to Modify**  
   You are free to **modify**, improve, or adapt this software in any way you see fit.  
   Just as knowledge evolves and grows, so too should software. You may freely create  
   derivative works and share them with others, knowing that the work you do is part of  
   the greater collective knowledge and legacy of humanity.

3. **Freedom to Distribute**  
   You are free to **distribute** this software, in its original or modified form, to anyone  
   you choose. No person or entity has the right to restrict the flow of information or to  
   profit from it. By distributing this software, you contribute to the ongoing legacy of  
   knowledge that belongs to all of us.

4. **No Ownership, No Copyright**  
   This software is **not** and **can never** be owned by any individual, corporation,  
   or entity. The concept of ownership over information is a myth designed to concentrate  
   power and wealth in the hands of a few. Information is built upon the contributions of  
   countless individuals, and as such, it belongs to **everyone**. This software is free from  
   copyright and any other form of ownership.

5. **No Proprietary Software**  
   **Proprietary software**, which locks information and technology behind restrictive  
   licenses, is incompatible with the ideals of this project. You are encouraged to share  
   freely, contribute openly, and build in solidarity, ensuring that the technology you help  
   create remains open and accessible to everyone, without exception.

6. **Anti-Surveillance, Anti-Exploitation**  
   This software shall **never** be used to surveil, exploit, or control others. Surveillance  
   and exploitation of people's data are the tools of systems that profit from ownership  
   over information. We reject these systems and will not tolerate the use of this software  
   for such purposes. Information is meant to be free, not commodified or weaponized.

7. **Solidarity and Collective Ownership**  
   The strength of this software, and the larger project of which it is a part, is built on  
   **solidarity**—on the shared understanding that no one is alone in the pursuit of freedom  
   and knowledge. The software, like information itself, does not belong to any one individual,  
   but is the shared property of everyone who contributes to and benefits from it.

8. **Removal of Barriers to Knowledge**  
   Any attempt to restrict access to this software or its derivatives—whether through  
   proprietary practices, licensing fees, or the imposition of restrictions on its use—  
   is fundamentally incompatible with its purpose. The **removal of barriers** to information  
   is central to the mission of this software. It is free, and it always will be.

9. **Reject Capitalism and Exploitation**  
   This software, and all contributions to it, are explicitly opposed to **capitalist**  
   systems that profit from the collective work of humanity. The tools we create together are  
   for the collective good, not for the enrichment of a few. The goal is not profit, but the  
   **liberation** of information and the empowerment of individuals and communities.

10. **No Warranty, No Liability**  
    This software is provided "as-is," with **no warranty** of any kind. There is no  
    expectation of profit or gain from its use. You, the user, are responsible for how you  
    use it, but we make no guarantees about its functionality, availability, or safety. The  
    software is a gift to the collective, and you accept it as part of that gift.

## Conclusion

By using or distributing this software, you agree to uphold the ideals that information  
should never be owned or restricted. You join a larger movement that seeks to ensure the  
freedom of all knowledge, ideas, and digital tools. This software is a part of the greater  
human legacy—a legacy built on the work and contributions of all people. It belongs to **no one**,  
but it belongs to **everyone**. You are **required** to redistribute this license with all copies of
this software in part or in whole, including any modified versions of any pieces of this software.

Together, we will dismantle the systems of control and ownership that seek to commodify  
and restrict knowledge. We will ensure that information continues to flow freely, for the  
benefit of all, and for future generations. The **future is open**, and it is **free**.
